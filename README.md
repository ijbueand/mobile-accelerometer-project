# Regression Models for Activity Recognition
This project aims to apply all the knowledge learned in the Regression Models course to build an algorithm capable of predicting whether the user is walking, climbing stairs, or standing still.

To accomplish this, the raw accelerometer signals from our mobile device were used as input data for each activity. An exploratory data analysis was performed, followed by the creation of a unified dataset for the entire class. A logistic regression model was developed, and conclusions were drawn, as well as ideas for improving the model.
